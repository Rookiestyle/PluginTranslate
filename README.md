# RSPluginTranslate
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/rookiestyle/rsplugintranslate)](https://github.com/rookiestyle/rsplugintranslate/releases/latest)


Add translation files to my plugins

* Load the template file in the plugin's translation folder
* Translate texts
* Save (replace 'template' with the language code that matches the KeePass language file)

If you create a translation for any of my plugins, please consider creating a pull request in the plugin's repository as well.
This way other users can benefit as well.
